   - **Braking**: Use the spacebar to brake. Mastering braking will help you navigate sharp turns without losing control of the vehicle.

### 2. **Choose the Right Vehicle**

## Pitfall Avoidance Tips

### 1. **Avoid Over-Speeding**
   - One common mistake beginners make is relying too heavily on speed. While speed is essential, uncontrolled speeding can lead to accidents or collisions. Start slow and increase speed as you gain confidence.

### 2. **Don’t Overuse Brakes**
   - Braking is crucial, but excessive braking can slow you down at inopportune times. Use brakes strategically in combination with steering to avoid hitting obstacles while maintaining momentum.

### 3. **Be Aware of Police Pursuit Mechanics**
   - As the game progresses, the police chase mechanics become more complicated. Beginners should avoid narrow or complex roads that make it harder to escape from police vehicles. Stick to wider, less crowded paths to avoid being caught.

### 2. **Misunderstanding the Game's Pace**
   - The game’s fast pace can be overwhelming for beginners. To adapt, start with shorter play sessions to get a feel for the speed and progressively increase your playtime. This will help reduce anxiety and improve your reaction times.
